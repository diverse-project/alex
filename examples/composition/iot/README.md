# Iot Usecase

This directory contains a set of projects in order to implement two Internet of Things (IoT) languages:
- **iot.lua** implements an IoT language using the *Lua* language as an expression language.
- **iot.simpleexpression** implements an IoT language using *Simpleexpression* and *Actionlanguage*, two simple languages dedicated respectively to the definition of expressions and actions.

Both languages are based around a common set of language concerns:
- An Interface Definition Language (IDL)
- An IoT language
- And Activity Diagram language

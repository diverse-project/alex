For more details about the language see TODO. TEL0 # Tiny Expression Language 0 (TEL0) is a toy expression language with two concepts: Integer Literal (e.g. 0, 1...) Sum operation (e.g. +) Abstract Syntax # We define the abstract syntax using ecore. This tutorial explains in details how to use ecore to define a metamodel. In order to understand the rest of this introduction, you only need to understand that ecore is a formalism to define metamodels and allows the generation of Java code that conforms to this definition. From the definition of TEL0, we define the following ecore model: We introduce the Exp abstract class in order to allow the recursive definition of sums (e.g. 1 + 2 + 3 + 4). From this metamodel definition we generate, using EMF, a set of java classes. You can find the implementation of TEL0 abstract syntax in github . Revisitor # In addition to the set of java class, Alex offers the generation of a abstract, visitor-like, interface called a Revisitor . To understand this tutorial, and to use Alex, it is not required to understand the Revisitor mechanism. Just know that it's generation is required in order to be able to define a semantics on top of the abstract syntax. The interested reader can consult the revisitor page to understand the internal details. Semantics # Once we have defined the abstract syntax of our language, we want to give it some meaning. The good news is, using Alex it is easy to define multiple meanings to a single abstract syntax in a modular way. We will show how to add a pretty printer and an evaluation semantics for TEL0, in a modular way. Pretty Printing # The pretty printer is a simple way to transform the object graph of an instance of the abstract syntax to a user readable string. For instance Add (LitVal(1), Add(LitVal(2), LitVal(3))) will be pretty printed to \"1 + 2 + 3\" . The following Alex program is the definition of the pretty print semantics for TEL0. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 behavior prettyprint import ecore platform:/resource/tel0.model/model/tel0.ecore open abstract class Exp { abstract def String print () } open class LitVal { override String print () { obj . value . toString } } open class Sum { override String print () { alg . $ ( obj . lhs ) . print () + + + alg . $ ( obj . rhs ) . print () } } This definition requires a few explanations. Line 1: Definition of the name of the semantics. Pretty much similar to a package definition. Line 3: Import of the abstract syntax. It defines the set of class on which we are able to define operations. Lines 5-7: Definition of the print operation on the Exp abstract class. As with every object-oriented language, it enforce that each child of Exp must provide a concrete implementation of the print method. Lines 9-13: Definition of the print operation for the LitVal class. We want use the toString operation to convert the long value to a string. But we are defining the pretty print semantics externally, consequently we don't have a direct access to the value field of the syntax. To have access to the syntactic values from the semantics, we must use the obj field provided by Alex for every open class, before being able to convert it to a string. Lines 15-19: Definition of the print operation for the Sum class. To pretty print a sum, we need to obtains the result of the print method for the left hand side (lhs) and right hand side (rhs) fields of the Sum class. But what we have currently is the obj field which gives use access to the syntactic part of the Sum class, which contains the lhs and rhs Exp expressions. Consequently, we don't have access to the print operation on the field so far. To do so, we fist needs to converts the syntactic value to semantics operations, using the alg field, also provided by Alex for each open class. This alg fields contains an instance of the currently defined semantics, in the form of a revisitor. The revisitor provides a methods called $ which take a syntactic object (e.g. Exp, Sum, LitVal) and returns a semantic operation, with all the operations defined in the Alex semantics. For instance alg.$(obj.lhs) returns an semantic operation with a print method. The good thing is, since obj.lhs is an abstract Exp object, we don't know statically if the returned semantic object will be for a Sum or a LitVal object, still we know that the returned value will be a string that we will be able to concatenate before returning the resulting string. Summary So far we have defined a first semantics for TEL0, which allow to pretty print arbitrary instances of TEL0 abstract syntax. A working implementation of TEL0 pretty printing is available in github Evaluation # Most of the useful concept of Alex are already covered by the definition of the pretty printing semantics. To highlight the ability of define new semantics modularily (i.e. without having to impact previously defined source code) for a single abstract syntax, we will show how to implement a evaluation semantics for TEL0. We simply have to create a new alex file, give it a new behavior name, and import the same ecore metamodel. Of course the signature of the open class methods and will be different. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 behavior evaluate import ecore platform:/resource/tel0.model/model/tel0.ecore open abstract class Exp { abstract def long eval () } open class LitVal { override long eval () { obj . value } } open class Sum { override long eval () { alg . $ ( obj . lhs ) . eval () + alg . $ ( obj . rhs ) . eval () } } We can observe that the structure is quite close to the pretty printer, the main different is the return type of eval, a long instead of a String. Consequently, if we execute the same Add (LitVal(1), Add(LitVal(2), LitVal(3))) program we obtains 6 instead of \"1 + 2 + 3\" . A working implementation of TEL0 pretty printing is available in github . Execution # So far we have defined two semantics for TEL0. But the interesting part is to be able to use our language to execute programs. The tel0.tests project, available on github , contains a single test class tel0.tests.Tel0Test which showcase how to use our language.
